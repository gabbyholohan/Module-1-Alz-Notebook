    "Data from the Allen Institute was used to determine the relationship between the APOE genotype and the age of onset of Alzheimer's. The Allen Institute's \"Integrated multimodal cell atlas of Alzheimer's disease\" used raw sequencing reads from ten unique public datasets, hosted on Synapse and the SRA, focused on the prefrontal cortex. Additionally, the Allen Institute's Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD) team applied snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, snMultiome, and MERFISH methods to study cells and nuclei from post-mortem human brain tissue provided by the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study and the University of Washington's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). Data from SEA-AD and the public databases include demographic information, diagnoses, and genotypes. Molecular data were expressed as gene expression counts, chromatin peak accessibility, and spatial coordinates. All data are from US donors."
